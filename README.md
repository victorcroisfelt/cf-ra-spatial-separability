# User-Centric Perspective in Random Access Cell-Free Aided by Spatial Separability
This is a research-oriented code package that is primarily intended to allow readers to replicate the results of the article mentioned below and also encourage and accelerate further research on this topic:

V. Croisfelt, T. Abrao, J. C., Marinello, “User-Centric Perspective in Random Access Cell-Free Aided by Spatial Separability,” to be published. Available on: https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10294.

I hope this content helps in your reaseach and contributes to building the precepts behind open science. Remarkably, in order to boost the idea of open science and further drive the evolution of science, I also motivate you to share your published results to the public.

If you have any questions and if you have encountered any inconsistency, please do not hesitate to contact me via victorcroisfelt@gmail.com.

## Abstract


## Content
The codes provided here can be used to simulate Figs. 3 to 6. The data of each figure is obtained by executing the script named after the respective figure. Further details about each file can be found inside them.
